## 📘 Project Overview

This project presents a **Credit Card Fraud Detection web application** developed as a **course project for the Modern Banking class**.  
The system applies **machine learning techniques** to analyze transaction behavior and determine whether a credit card transaction is **fraudulent or legitimate**.

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how data-driven models can support **risk management and fraud prevention** in modern banking systems.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Apply machine learning techniques in a banking-related problem  
- Detect fraudulent transactions based on behavioral patterns  
- Develop a simple and interactive web-based interface  
- Demonstrate the role of technology in modern banking systems  

---

## ⚙️ System Description

The application allows the user to enter transaction-related features such as:
- Distance from the cardholder’s home  
- Distance from the previous transaction  
- Purchase amount relative to the median transaction value  
- Transaction type indicators (online transaction, chip usage, PIN usage, etc.)

Based on these inputs, the system predicts whether the transaction is **safe** or **fraudulent**.
